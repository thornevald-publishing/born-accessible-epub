    <h1>What This Means for Your Backlist</h1>
    <p>There is no automatic exemption for legacy ebooks.<br/>
    If a title is still <strong>for sale, licensed, or downloadable in the EU</strong>, it is considered <em>on the market</em> and must comply.</p>
    <p>In practical terms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>EPUB 2 files are at risk</li>
      <li>Titles without semantic structure or accessibility metadata will fail future validation</li>
      <li>Backlist titles will be the first to be de-prioritised or flagged by retailers and libraries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Enforcement will be incremental and uneven. Reduced discoverability, silent delisting, or rejection at the point of update is more likely than immediate penalties.</p>
    <p>The EAA regulates the <strong>present</strong>, not the past.</p>
